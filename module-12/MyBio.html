          <p>During my first years working in Supply Chain, I moved my way up from being an associate to assistant
            manager. I then completed an Area Manager Internship to which I was offered a fulltime offer as an Area
            manager. I gained enough experience on how to lead a group of 50+ people as well as being in charge of the
            dock and packages making to customers on time. In addition I had extra duties such as labor tracking,
            problem solving, and covering for managers. </p>
